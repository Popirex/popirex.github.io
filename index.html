                <h3>Solar Tracker Arduino</h3>
                <p>Single-axis autonomous sun tracking system using photoresistors and servo motor to automatically follow light sources. Built with Arduino, custom 3D-printed parts, and featuring real-time efficiency visualization through LED indicator. The solar panel directly powers a red LED: when the tracker finds optimal alignment, brightness increases by 40% — immediate visual proof of efficiency gains.</p>

        <h1>About Popirex</h1>
        <h3>Me</h3>
        <p>
            Since the first time I came in touch with an Arduino I completely fell in love with programming.
            The amount of creative expression some lines of code can give you is IMMENSE.
            As a regular Gen Z I have always been in contact with the internet, but I had never made a webpage until the most recent years of my life;
            and well, since the first page, it has always made me really happy to be a creator on the web (even with 0 recognition).
            Just being able to write whatever I want, and having the opportunity to actually see it on the web is so cool in my opinion I can't get enough of it.
        </p>
        <h3>My Web Making Journey</h3>
        <p>
            When I started University I came in touch with p5.js for the first time, and well from that point on I HAD to keep making simulations just for the fun of it.
            And so "Exploring Code" was born — a page that keeps growing every time curiosity strikes, and probably always will.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second page I ever made was for my brother. He had just renovated his old apartment to put it on Airbnb, so I felt it was a good occasion to make him a website
            that acted like a brochure for the house. It's probably the page I spent most of my time making since it has many connected pages and some (like the activities page) took a long time to make.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third page, one for which I am VERY proud of, is the 'Light Transmission Simulation', made with a friend of mine for a statistics and probability exam.
            We obviously decided that it was too boring to just create a PowerPoint presentation full of numbers — we actually wanted everyone to be able to see what our project was about and be like "Oh okay this makes sense!".
            So the project went from a few hours of work to about a week of full day programming, but it was all worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "Gattati" page was made in one day, just because I had just learned how to actually use PHP to make API requests and I wanted to put it to good use.
            It's a very simple page, but as long as it can make my friends have a laugh it was totally worth it.
            Shoutout to the cataas API that made all of this possible, fantastic work!! <a href="https://cataas.com/">Check out the Cataas API</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Then there's the <strong>Solar Tracker Arduino</strong> — a proper hardware project that gave me a completely different kind of satisfaction from anything I'd built on a screen before.
            Seeing it actually move and lock onto the light in real life? Priceless.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Phonebook Database page is a bit of a special case — it's purely theoretical because I actually use the database in real life to keep my contacts organized,
            and obviously I don't want anyone's phone numbers floating around on the web. But it was a great exercise and I had a lot of fun making it since it has a genuine real-world use.
