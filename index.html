        <h1>About Popirex</h1>
        <h3>Me</h3>
        <p>
            Since the first time I came in touch with an Arduino I completely fell in love with programming.
            The amount of creative expression some lines of code can give you is IMMENSE.
            As a regular Gen Z I have always been in contact with the internet, but I had never made a webpage until the most recent years of my life;
            and well, since the first page, it has always made me really happy to be a creator on the web (even with 0 recognition).
            Just being able to write whatever I want, and having the opportunity to actually see it on the web is so cool in my opinion I can't get enough of it.
        </p>
        <h3>My Web Making Journey</h3>
        <p>
            When I started University I came in touch with p5.js for the first time, and well from that point on I HAD to keep making simulations just for the fun of it.
            And there my first somewhat useful page was born, called "Exploring Code" - it contains the three simulations I am most proud of, all made just for the sake of curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second page I ever made was for my brother. He had just renovated his old apartment to put it on Airbnb, so I felt it was a good occasion to make him a website 
            that acted like a brochure for the house. It's probably the page I spent most of my time making since it has many connected pages and some (like the activities page) took a long time to make.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third page, one for which I am VERY proud of, is the 'Light Transmission Simulation', made with a friend of mine for a statistics and probability exam.
            The objective of the project was to create a presentation with all the calculations and diagrams deducted from data obtained by mathematical simulations about a bunch of photons in a fiber optic cable.
            We obviously decided that it was too boring to just create a PowerPoint presentation full of numbers; we actually wanted everyone to be able to see what our project was about and how it worked and be like "Oh okay this makes sense!".
            So the project went from a few hours of work to about a week of full day programming, but it was all worth it. Our teacher was very proud and we had something to share also with our friends and family.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "Gattati" page was made in one day, just because I had just learned how to actually use the PHP language to make requests and I wanted to make use of what I had learned. 
            It's a very simple page, but as long as it can make my friends have a laugh for me it was totally worth it.
            I also want to make a recognition for the cataas API that made all of this possible, fantastic work!!
        </p>
        <p>
            The last page (except the one you are looking at) is the Phonebook Database page. It's purely theoretical because I use the actual database to keep organized all my contacts
            and obviously I don't want any of my friends and family phone numbers to be free on the web.
            In any way that page was born to make a sort of 'presentation' of the work you have to make in order to idealize, make a scheme of and build a functional database. I had a lot of fun making it
            since it has an actual use in the real world and it's not just a theoretical project.
